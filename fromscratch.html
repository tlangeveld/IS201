    <div class="blahblah"><center><h2>The Battle of Length</h2></center></div>
    <div>As you can probably tell, I am pretty passionate about my fantasy books. I am always up
        for a good discussion (debate) about what books are best and which ones are overrated. 
        Recently, I had a chancce to prove my own opinions right as well as use some VBA skills.
        I am taking a Young Adult Literature class, and my professor has been pretty vocal about his
        disdain for fantasy, citing the length of the books as his main reason why. Of course, as a fan of the genre, I could not let that slide. For a 
        research paper in the class, I gathered data about the average user enjoyment of books 
        and how that enjoyment related to their length. My hypothesis was that due to the higher 
        complexity and depth of longer books, they would be more enjoyable to the people who read them.
    <center><h3>The Gathering</h3></center>
        To get data, I went through a list of the top selling books of all time, finding their 
        word counts and then finding their GoodReads rating. After finding 15 books in each length group,
        which I classified as "Short" (<100,000 words), "Medium" (100,000-150,000 words), and "Long"
        (>150,000 words), I wrote a nice little VBA program that found the average GoodReads rating and
        word count for each length group. My results proved my hypothesis correct! I was able to 
        provide numerical evidence (albeit from a small sample size) that the average reader likes 
        long books better!
